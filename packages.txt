## System packages (only enable those you need)
# Leave this file empty to avoid installing additional system packages on Streamlit Cloud.
# Uncomment packages below ONLY if you re-enable native dependencies in `requirements.txt`.
# For rembg/onnxruntime you may need some of these:
# python3-dev
# build-essential   # compilers and make
# libgomp1          # OpenMP runtime (for some wheels)
# libopenblas-dev   # BLAS/LAPACK (optional)
# cmake             # build system (rarely needed)
